# Mini10
NTDEV's Tiny10 but more private

[![Mini10 Autobuild](https://github.com/usefulstuffs/Mini10/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/usefulstuffs/Mini10/actions/workflows/release.yml)

## What Mini10 is:
- A private and malware-free operating system
- A very lightweight Windows build
- An easly customizable operating system

## What Mini10 is not:
- A preactivated operating system (you need an LTSC 2019 license)
- A gamers-side operating system
- A program to optimize your PC, this builds a Windows ISO

## How to build
It's easy to build, just download and extract all files (I reccommend extracting them on the root of the C:\ drive).
Then double click build.cmd and allow any UAC prompt. It will build for you

## Common issues
1. Installing this build on a NVMe drive may result in a bluescreen with INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE (0x00007B) because of a driver missing
